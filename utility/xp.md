# XP
Beemo's XP system allows for members to gain experience as they participate in the server via text & voice channels.

---

## About

Users can gain XP through both text and voice channels, with customizable curves and role rewards for levels. Servers can add roles to be rewarded at different level milestones and benefit from an integrated XP leaderboard.

If enabled alongside XP, users will also gain Honey at the same rate, which is consumable in a Honey role shop. See https://docs.beemo.gg/utility/honey for more information on the Honey shop.

| xp reset leave [enable]                    | `/xp reset leave enable:true`               | Sets if user XP / honey should be reset upon leaving the server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| xp notifications enable [status]           | `/xp notifications enable status:false`     | Sets if a level up notification should be sent when a user levels up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| xp notifications channel [channel name/id] | `/xp notifications channel channel:#notify` | Sets the channel to send level up notifications to. Put none for the channel name to remove a set channel. If no channel is specified, the notice will be sent to the user's DMs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| xp cooldown rankcommand [seconds]          | `/xp cooldown rankcommand seconds:5`        | Sets the cooldown in seconds for the /rank command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| xp difficulty [new difficulty (decimal)]   | `/xp difficulty value:2.0`                  | Sets the difficulty of the XP system. This modifies the multiplier so that the amount of XP needed to reach the next level is either larger or smaller. IMPORTANT: This setting will change the XP curve, which will affect the current level of all users.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| xp leveltoxpratio [new ratio (decimal)]    | `/xp leveltoxpratio value:1.5`              | This modifies the exponent of the XP function, which changes the relationship between XP gained and level achieved. The curve is determined by the formula: `XP = Difficulty * (Level)^(Level to XP Ratio) + 4`. For example, a difficulty of 1.2 and a level to XP ratio of 3.1 will result in a curve of `xp = 1.2 * level^3.1 + 4`, which means that it requires `xp` xp to be acquired in order to reach `level` level. |
